# 🧠 Local LLM Chat App

A real-time, privacy-preserving chat application built with:

* **Streamlit** for the user interface
* **FastAPI** for the backend API
* **Ollama** to run local Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA3, Mistral, or Phi

> ✅ Fully local & offline | ✅ Private & secure | ✅ Fast | ✅ Free & Open Source

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Most AI chat interfaces rely on cloud-based APIs, which:

* Compromise user data privacy
* Introduce latency and incur usage costs
* Require constant internet access

**Goal:** Build a lightweight, responsive, local LLM-powered chat app that works entirely on your **Ubuntu 24.04** machine using open-source tools and models.

## 📀 Architecture

```
User ────> Streamlit UI ────> FastAPI Backend ────> Ollama API ────> Local LLM
```

* Users interact via the Streamlit UI
* Messages are sent to the FastAPI backend
* Backend forwards them to Ollama
* Ollama responds with generated text
* UI displays the assistant's reply in real-time
